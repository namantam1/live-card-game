# Valid Card Play Rules

## Trump Suit

- Spade is the trump suit of the game
- A Spade card will defeat any card of other suits, regardless of rank

## Following Lead Suit

- When a player throws a card, other players must throw a higher card of the same suit if they have one
- If they don't have a higher value card of the same suit, they are free to throw any card of the same suit
- If they don't have any card of the lead suit at all, they must throw a Spade card

## Playing Trump When Void in Lead Suit

When you cannot follow the lead suit and a trump (Spade) has already been played:

### Standard Compulsory Trumping (Default)

- If you have Spades that can beat the current highest card on the table, you must play one of those higher Spades
- If you only have lower Spades that cannot beat the current highest card, you must still play a Spade (wasting it)
- If you have no Spade cards at all, you can then throw any card of your choice

### Overtake Exception (Optional)

- If you have Spades that can beat the current highest card on the table, you must play one of those higher Spades
- If you only have lower Spades that cannot beat the current highest card, you can throw any card of your choice (not forced to waste your trump)
- If you have no Spade cards at all, you can throw any card of your choice
